You work for the ***City of Seattle***. To achieve its goal of becoming a carbon-neutral city by 2050, your team is closely examining the energy consumption and emissions of **non-residential buildings**.

Detailed surveys were conducted by city officials in 2016. However, these surveys are costly to carry out. Based on the data already collected, **your task is to estimate the** ***CO2 emissions*** **and** ***total energy consumption*** **of non-residential buildings for which measurements have not yet been taken**.

Your predictions will rely on the structural data of the buildings (size and usage, year of construction, geographic location, etc.).

You will also evaluate the potential usefulness of the **ENERGY STAR Score** for predicting emissions, as it is currently labor-intensive to calculate using your team's existing approach. You will incorporate it into the modeling process and assess its value.

**Key skills involved :**

- Data cleaning
- Exploratory analysis
- Feature engineering
- Implementation and comparison of various supervised learning algorithms
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Feature importance analysis
